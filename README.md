# A TavernUI Character extension for oobabooga's Text Generation WebUI

This extension features a character searcher, downloader and manager for any TavernAI
cards.

> [!CAUTION]
> Version 2+ of this extension has been adapted to work with Oobabooga's WebUI version 3+. Please update your installation as this will be the supported version from now on. If you have a previous version of this extension, make sure to either: update the extension and WebUI or not update the extension.

## General features
- Main page recent and random cards, as well as random categories upon main page launch
- Card filtering with text search, NSFW blocking* and category filtering
- Card downloading
- Card contents previewing
- Offline card manager
- Search and delete downloaded cards

**Disclaimer: As TavernAI is a community supported character database, characters may often be mis-categorized, or may be NSFW when they are marked as not being NSFW.*

This extension was made for [oobabooga's text generation webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui).

## Installation
You need a little bit of coding knowldge (close to none, but the more the better).

If you used a 'one-click-installer', open the `CMD_FLAGS.txt` file inside your installation folder.

If you used the 'portable' version or newer, you can find `CMD_FLAGS.txt` inside the `user_data` folder.

To activate the extension, you must add the following to an existing line or new line (if no other startup flags are used):
```
--extensions webui_tavernai_charas
```

With this, the extension activates and you will see upon restart of the WebUI a new section with the extension contents.

For more information on how to install and activate users, please refer to the [original documentation by oobaboga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/docs/Extensions.md)
